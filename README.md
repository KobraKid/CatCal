### How to get this project on your Mac
Click [here](https://github.com/blog/2375-clone-in-xcode) for a demonstration on how to clone this project into Xcode.

### How to use this app
When you first run the app, you will be asked to sign in to Google. I *highly* suggest you sign in using your **Northwestern Google account** so that you can access the test calendar that I have the app set to use. Otherwise, feel free to sign in to your person account and use your own calendar to test the app. I don't mind if you use my test calendar.

Once the project has been cloned, you are free to run the app, test it, play around and make changes to experiment with different parts of the code. See if you're able to change the size of each CalendarCell, or try adding a new button to the Navigation bar that adds or deletes an event.

Another thing to note about the app (in its current state) is that when it first opens, the list of events is empty regardless of whether any events exist on a calendar or not. I encourage you to figure out why this is the case, and see if you can solve this problem. I haven't implemented a solution yet because I haven't been bothered by clicking 'Refresh' but obviously a fully polished app should be able to automatically fetch this list right away.

### Errors
Please let me know if you have any problems cloning this project, or if you come across any errors/bugs. I'll be happy to take a look.
